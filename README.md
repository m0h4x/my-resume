üëã Hi, I‚Äôm this guy who reads some programming books in Russian (mostly) and puts them on the Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@blu3h4t/featured

üëÄ I have been to this rabbit hole of Gnu and Linux for a decade or two already. So i'm quite familiar with the subjects/topics discussed here: 
Linux is a MAJOR Rabbit Hole - https://youtu.be/uGS6BdmUU1c
To the extent that i did compile the kernel some day and installed arch linux some other. Nothing major.
I have also ran Proxmox VM's (https://www.proxmox.com/en/) at HIVT (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoger_Instituut_voor_Vertalers_en_Tolken)
with FOG project: https://fogproject.org/ and OCS Inventory: https://ocsinventory-ng.org/?lang=en

üå± After being to the GNU/Linux rabit hole for a few years i tought why not learn some scripting, oh boy. That proved to also be quite some rabit hole.
So i boutght like a hundred programming books in a few years and not even half read half of them. But i ended up at this JS/React/Frontend/FullStack Bootcamp for a year - https://goit.global/us/courses/fullstack/. So became somewhat familiar with this fascinating topic: 
React.js: The Documentary - https://youtu.be/8pDqJVdNa44

üíûÔ∏è As for my other endeavours. Some day after visiting revision demoparty: https://youtu.be/B3EyfSP1VSc
I tried my hands at soldering a Sinclair 8-bit retro computer, and it actually even worked, amazing :D

Otherwise i also happen to have a privilege to be responsible for automating and updating like two thirds of like a hundred software packages at our campus. But after a ten year project of finishing the half done automatisation of this software packages i ended up put away in a cubicle to only do tech support. There is nothing else to this life right? right?!
