üëã Hi, I‚Äôm this guy who reads some programming books in Russian (mostly) and puts them on the Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@blu3h4t/featured

üëÄ I have been to this rabbit hole of Gnu and Linux for a decade or two already. 
https://youtu.be/dPh0lhL_Nx8
So i'm quite familiar with the subjects/topics discussed here: 
Linux is a MAJOR Rabbit Hole - https://youtu.be/uGS6BdmUU1c
To the extent that i did compile the kernel some day and installed arch linux some other. Nothing major.
I have also ran Proxmox VM's (https://www.proxmox.com/en/) at HIVT (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoger_Instituut_voor_Vertalers_en_Tolken)
with FOG project: https://fogproject.org/ and OCS Inventory: https://ocsinventory-ng.org/?lang=en

üå± After being to the GNU/Linux rabit hole for a few years i tought why not learn some scripting, oh boy. That proved to also be quite some rabit hole.
So i boutght like a hundred programming books in a few years and only half read half of them. But i ended up at this JS/React/Frontend/FullStack Bootcamp for a year - https://goit.global/us/courses/fullstack/. So became somewhat familiar with this fascinating topic: 
React.js: The Documentary - https://youtu.be/8pDqJVdNa44

üíûÔ∏è As for my other endeavours. Some day after visiting revision demoparty: https://youtu.be/B3EyfSP1VSc
I tried my hands at soldering a Sinclair 8-bit retro computer, and it actually even worked, amazing :D

Otherwise i also happen to have a privilege to be responsible for automating and updating like two thirds of like a hundred software packages at our campus. But after a ten year project of finishing the half done automatisation of this software packages i ended up put away in a cubicle to only do tech support. There is nothing else to this life right? right?!

After 20 years of using Linux 
and after 10 years of studying programming 
this is my conclusion and this is my verdict.
In the sixties Lisp gave us garbage collection.
In the seventies eighties Smalltalk gave us type inference.
And then in the nineties Erlang gave us the actor model.
Now what concerns the linux distributions:
Debian is the most ancient software collection and installer.
OpenSuse is a somewhat more sane distribution
with somewhat more modern software and installer.
(Like say a better centos alternative(for the desktop)).
Both of them have a stable and rolling version.
Thumbleweed being a more modern/sane one.
Debian we can say is antiquated like solaris.
But what is very modern and easier
to install than debian is arch.
A thumbleweedish version of it is Manjaro.
But this is all just history.
Accidentally or not these distros
support kde which i wouldnt use.
If we would look at something more practical,
(which also happens to support Gnome)
Your best option probably would be Mint or Zorin.
Or even better the Ultimate linux distribution Fedora.
There is also something to say about JS, RB and Py.
Will add something on this later.
